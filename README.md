# drawing-app
This is a school project about drawing shapes.
(a drawing application that places object in the given area according to the coordinates provided by the user.)

At the time my C# experience and my knowledge about drawing algorithm was so little. And still is. These things are did not got my attention.
There is an inadequate and inefficient drawing app just for you.(I just wanted to add this code here nothing special about it)

There is no comment lines yet. I will work on it later.
